# Nuggets of Wisdom from NormConf 2022


A week ago I've attended [NormConf - The Normcore Tech Conference](https://normconf.com/) - and I've truly enjoyed it. In fact, I've enjoyed it so much, that I've decided to write a blog post about it, in order to summraize some learnings, but also to promote the conference. The idea behind NormConf is simple: let's highlight the mundane, unsexy, normcore, day-to-day stuff that is actaully done by data scientist and machine learning engineers. So instead of talking about how our awesome recommendation engine uses the latest and greatest algorithms, let's talk about how did we actually solve our Python dependency issues.

This idea is really powerful, it frees you from the necessity to show off, to brag about your system, and gives space to talk about basic engineering struggles. Thinking about it in a philosophycal way, I could say that this allows the speakers to show vulnerability in a technical sense, humanizing them, bringing them close to the audience, we have all been there. It's a fresh take on tech conferences, and in my opinion a very welcomed one.

While the conference is mainly targetting data and ml people, most of the learnings can be applied to wide range of jobs, so don't be discouraged by that. I've got to say big kudos to the whole organizing team and to the speakers, who come off as really kind people and great educators. All images and ideas are taken directly form the conference, with the original author mentioned and linked. So with that let's dive in.
