### The main takeaways:


### Other interesing ideas


---

### Tech lead

- good communcation & listening - reporting
- good prio skills - planning, break-down
- pick up the pieces - make it happen, keep the project moving
- understand the architecture
- don't do only interesting/boring things

Influence without authority
API first design
Critical vs Optimal identification
The value of planning is to force forethought and deep thinking (not to come up with the perfect plan)

### Project Management
- break down the complex end goal into smaller pieces (milestones)
- prioritize, set order tasks should be done in
- risk & uncertainty - leads to slow downs and fail
- push throught the details unknowns
- adjust the plan on the fly
- launch/rollback plan

### Managing People

It's an Emotional Labor - soft skills to address the emotional need of people/teams
- Patience
- Emphaty
- Human Connections
- Mentoring - useful both ways (the mentor pratices communicaiton skills and listening)

**Rule of management: No surprises!** - especially negative one. communicate often, early & keep records

Get to know people:
- what gets them excited/motivated
- what frustrates them
- goals - in life/in career
- communication stlye / expectations - meeting frequency | info sharing | review frequency
- prase/feedback - give it quick

1-on-1:
- keep a common shared doc - with topics/notes/todos/follow-ups/feedback
- driven by employee
- workplace problems
 - deal with it or put it aside for now, by agreement
 - complaining just increases drama
- deep dives
- how to measure sucess & progress? - requires goals & plans

Micro-Management vs Autonomy
- lack of trust
- trying to control outcome to meet your standards
- stripping talented/creative people of autonomy - decreases motivation

Hiding information - real FAILURE of manager/team
Getting stuck or Making mistakes - just an opportunities for learning


### Continous Feedback and Performance Evaluations

- pay attention in every sprint, and highlight
  - 1. talents & achievements
  - 2. improvement areas - and only focus on main thing
- be specific (examples) - fight against bias  
- common themes for improvement areas
  - struggle saying no (distracted, not focusing on prio)
  - hard for others to work with (rude, overly critical)
  - does not work well across teams, with other teams
  - struggle to break up work (balancing planning/design - with getting things done)
  - cutting corners and not following best practices 
- **if no/little meaningful feedback for improvement == ready for promotion / or to be given more challenging work**

As a manager you need to know how to play the "promotion game", how to showcase your people for promotions.


###  Managing teams
 
- identify & clear bottlenecks and roadblocks
- keep team focused on top prio deliveries
- clear communication: timeline & scope
- learn how to work with smarted/techier people
- supporting people is more important than tech skills
- but you have to remain technical - coding, stay connected - as it makes your job easier

##### Debugging Teams

Basic disfunctions:
 - not shipping (meeting small goals)
 - people drama and negative effects on team dynamics (brilliant asshole)
 - unhappiness due to overwork
 - collaboration problem

How to drive good team decisions:
 - guide, not dictate decision
 - use data to support
 - review assumptions after project is done - that's how you learn to make better decisions
 - approach for conflicts:
   - conflict avoider - easier, but hits you back harder later
   - conflict tamer - harder, but better in the long run
 - don't always rely on consensus/voting - because not everyone has equal stakes/knowledge/bias
 - depersonalise decisions - standars/process 
 - you are free to disagree - but you have to understand why, where are other opinions coming from (cannot just assume ignorace/stupidity)

Disrespecting manager/team members:
- ask why are they working here, do they want to keep working here?
- Y: there are rules/standards to follow - if they want to keep working here
- N: start process to move team/leave company

As an IC (Individual Contributor) you get quick wins, short feedback loops:
- test pass
- new feature shipped
- bug fixed
As a Manager you get no quick wins, long feedback loops:
- set goals
- clarify requirements
- follow-up on task completion

### Project Management

Rules of thumb:
- Q1 more productive than Q4
- ~10 weeks per engineer/per quarter for focused work
- doubling rule - when doing estimations
- 20% of capacity retained for genering sustaining work

 Managing time:
 - importance vs urgency
 - efficient meeting - agenda / up-front work-reading / summary-conclusion documented
