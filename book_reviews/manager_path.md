##### Tech lead

- good communcation & listening - reporting
- good prio skills - planning, break-down
- pick up the pieces - make it happen, keep the project moving
- understand the architecture
- don't do only interesting/boring things

Influence without authority
API first design
Critical vs Optimal identification
The value of planning is to force forethought and deep thinking (not to come up with the perfect plan)

### Project Management
- break down the complex end goal into smaller pieces (milestones)
- prioritize, set order tasks should be done in
- risk & uncertainty - leads to slow downs and fail
- push throught the details unknowns
- adjust the plan on the fly
- launch/rollback plan

### Managing People

It's an Emotional Labor - soft skills to address the emotional need of people/teams
- Patience
- Emphaty
- Human Connections
- Mentoring - useful both ways (the mentor pratices communicaiton skills and listening)

Get to know people:
- what gets them excited/motivated
- what frustrates them
- goals - in life/in career
- communication stlye / expectations - meeting frequency | info sharing | review frequency
- prase/feedback - give it quick

1-on-1:
- keep a common shared doc - with topics/notes/todos/follow-ups/feedback
- driven by employee
- workplace problems
 - deal with it or put it aside for now, by agreement
 - complaining just increases drama
- deep dives
- how to measure sucess & progress? - requires goals & plans

Micro-Management vs Autonomy
- lack of trust
- trying to control outcome to meet your standards
- stripping talented/creative people of autonomy - decreases motivation

Hiding information - real FAILURE of manager/team
Getting stuck or Making mistakes - just an opportunities for learning
