## High level overview of the book:
Presents two emotion theories:
 - the *classical theory of emotions* does not stand up to evidence anymore
 - a new theory of *constructed emotions* is a better fit to the scientific evidence
    - and also provides useful tools to think about emotions and improve our lifes

Advices:
  - if emotions are constructed, you are in part responsible for what you feel and how you interpret the world
    - work on your emotional granularity, rich set of concept is toolbox for a meaningful life
    - reframe emotions and situations, deconstructing the self - is this causing me real physical harm or it's just a threat to my ego/self
  - everything we feel and do is influenced by our body budget (hungry,tired,in pain)
    - balance your body budget by eating healthy, sleeping enough and exercising
  - watch out for the mental inference fallacy - attribute mental state to physical behavior
    - a mental state can have vastly different manifestations

## Classical Theory of Emotions - Essentialism
  - states that emotions are localized to individual parts of the brain (e.g.the fear circuit/network) - one-to-one mapping
    - however a metastudy found no consistent emotional fingerprints in the brain - no dedicated circuit
    - each instance of an emotion can vary a lot, using different brain parts
  - states that emotions are the reactions of the brain to a certain situation
    - reactive brain would be metabolically less efficient than a predicting/correcting brain
