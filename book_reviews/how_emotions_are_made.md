## Main message of the book:
 - the *classical theory of emotions* does not stand up to evidence anymore
 - a new theory of *constructed emotions* is a better fit to the scientific evidence
    - and also provides useful tools to think about emotions and improve our lifes

## Classical Theory of Emotions
  - states that emotions are localized to individual parts of the brain (e.g.the fear circuit/network) - one-to-one mapping
    - however a metastudy found no consistent emotional fingerprints in the brain - no dedicated circuit
    - each instance of an emotion can vary a lot, using different brain parts
  - states that emotions are the reactions of the brain to a certain situation
    - reactive brain would be metabolically less efficient than a predicting/correcting brain    
    
## Categories
  - classical category - prototype, traits
      - a bird - has feather and wings and can fly - almost every instance fits the description, all physically similar
  - funcitonal category - abstract, goal based
      - things that have value and can be used to exchange goods - money, real estate, salt
      - things that protect you from the rain - umbrella, roof, a dont-care attitude
      - instances can be vastly different physically, but they are united by the abstract concept of serving the same funcionality/goal
      - these categories are human constructed - we impose meaning on the phyisical objects and have a common agreement on it
      

## Constructed Emotions Theory
  - an emotion - is a funcional category
      - it is a collection of diverse instances, mental events (such as fear) are not created by only one set of neurons, but different combinations of neurons can create instances of fear (multipurpose neurons)
  - the brain is constanly predicting - anticipating the best guess of what's going on - and how to keep you alive and well
      - the brain uses concepts (past experience) to make sense of internal & external stimuli
      - an emotion - is the brains creation of what your bodily sensations mean in relation to whas going on around you
      
      
## Affective realism
What you feel alters whay you see and hear, and not the other way around

Affect composed of two main factors:
 - the body's energy bugdet (hunger, tiredness, pain)
 - interoceptive feelings (pleasant/unpleasant and calm/jittery-excited)
     - pressure on skin has calming effect (hug, weighted blanket)
     - soft touch results in excitement (tickling)
     
 Affectice realism - affect can mislead us, we can misjudge the world:
  - hungry judges rule harsher sentences - they precieve the crimes as more serious incorrectly 
  - flu on a date might make you have fever and stomach pain - which you can misinterpret as blushing and butterflies

You might like to think you are a purely rational being, but interoceptive feeling influence your every decision


## Constructing emotions = making affect meaningful
 - the brain makes a lot of predicitions with different probabilities (based past experience and sensations)
 - these predictions compete to explain what causes the sensations and determine how you feel/act/percieve
 - the most probable prediction becomes your perception
 - successful communication is based on  synchronized emotional concept prediction - same goal and same situation
 
## Babies and statistical learning
Small children think their preferences are everyones preferences (if they like chocolate, everyone like chocolate)
 - they think every think the same/knows the same/preferes the same
 - as they grow, they lear to do mental inference
 - recognize that others have different knowledge in their had, which can be accesses through speech/words
