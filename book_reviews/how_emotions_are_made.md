## High level overview of the book:
Presents two emotion theories:
 - the *classical theory of emotions* does not stand up to evidence anymore
 - a new theory of *constructed emotions* is a better fit to the scientific evidence
    - and also provides useful tools to think about emotions and improve our lifes

Advices:
  - if emotions are constructed, you are in part responsible for what you feel and how you interpret the world
    - work on your emotional granularity, rich set of concept is toolbox for a meaningful life
    - reframe emotions and situations, deconstructing the self - is this causing me real physical harm or it's just a threat to my ego/self
  - everything we feel and do is influenced by our body budget (hungry,tired,in pain)
    - balance your body budget by eating healthy, sleeping enough and exercising
  - watch out for the mental inference fallacy - attribute mental state to physical behavior
    - a mental state can have vastly different manifestations

## Classical Theory of Emotions - Essentialism
  - states that emotions are localized to individual parts of the brain (e.g.the fear circuit/network) - one-to-one mapping
    - however a metastudy found no consistent emotional fingerprints in the brain - no dedicated circuit
    - each instance of an emotion can vary a lot, using different brain parts
  - states that emotions are the reactions of the brain to a certain situation
    - reactive brain would be metabolically less efficient than a predicting/correcting brain    
    
## Categories
  - classical category - prototype, traits
      - a bird - has feather and wings and can fly - almost every instance fits the description, all physically similar
  - funcitonal category - abstract, goal based
      - things that have value and can be used to exchange goods - money, real estate, salt
      - things that protect you from the rain - umbrella, roof, a dont-care attitude
      - instances can be vastly different physically, but they are united by the abstract concept of serving the same funcionality/goal
      - these categories are human constructed - we impose meaning on the phyisical objects and have a common agreement on it
      

## Constructed Emotions Theory
  - an emotion - is a funcional category
      - it is a collection of diverse instances, mental events (such as fear) are not created by only one set of neurons, but different combinations of neurons can create instances of fear (multipurpose neurons)
  - the brain is constanly predicting - anticipating the best guess of what's going on - and how to keep you alive and well
      - the brain uses concepts (past experience) to make sense of internal & external stimuli
      - an emotion - is the brains creation of what your bodily sensations mean in relation to whas going on around you
      
      
## Affective realism
What you feel alters whay you see and hear, and not the other way around

Affect composed of two main factors:
 - the body's energy bugdet (hunger, tiredness, pain)
 - interoceptive feelings (pleasant/unpleasant and calm/jittery-excited)
     - pressure on skin has calming effect (hug, weighted blanket)
     - soft touch results in excitement (tickling)
     
 Affectice realism - affect can mislead us, we can misjudge the world:
  - hungry judges rule harsher sentences - they precieve the crimes as more serious incorrectly 
  - flu on a date might make you have fever and stomach pain - which you can misinterpret as blushing and butterflies

You might like to think you are a purely rational being, but interoceptive feeling influence your every decision


## Constructing emotions = making affect meaningful
 - the brain makes a lot of predicitions with different probabilities (based past experience and sensations)
   - these predictions compete to explain what causes the sensations and determine how you feel/act/percieve
   - the most probable prediction becomes your perception
   - emotions are meaning 
     - they prescribe an action - to cope, improve survival
     - they communicate, influence others
 
 - successful communication is based on  synchronized emotional concept prediction - same goal and same situation
 - helps with the human strugge - getting ahead vs getting along (benefit yourself or please others)
 
## Babies and learning
Small children think their preferences are everyones preferences (if they like chocolate, everyone like chocolate)
 - they think everyone thinks the same/knows the same/preferes the same
 - as they grow, they learn to do mental inference
 - recognize that others have different knowledge in their had, which can be accesses through speech/words
      
Words are powerful, they label reality and point out similarities (beyond the physical) 
 - words allow to create purly mental concepts, which can be used to control your body budget and survive
 - some of these mental concepts are emotions, which serve as explanations for feelings/deeds and communication
      
## Social reality - a human superpower
If a tree falls and no one is around to hear it does it make a sound?
 - it does, but that sound cannot be interpreted as a tree falling without a human brain
 - tree falls -> air pressure changes -> ear -> brain that knows the concept of tree, has experience of trees falling, so it is not experiencially blind to it
 
Phyisical reality vs Constructed experiences (social reality)
 - the latter only exists for those who are equipped to percieve it (concepts, past experience)
 - just give it a name and make people agree on it and it becomes real (in a social sense) - imposing meaning

How do emotions become real
 - people need to agree on the concepts, shared understanding - anger exists with a certain function
 - language - is an effective tool to wire each other's brain, words help grouping into concepts
