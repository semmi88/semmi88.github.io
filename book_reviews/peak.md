### The main problem/question posed by the book:
- How do people become expert performers?
- Can we learn from expert performers how to improve our skills?

### The main takeaways:
- We are all born with a gift: the adaptability of our mind and body
  - The body's and the mind's adaptability outweights any genetic differences that may give some people advantage in the beginning
- There is no such thing as innate talent, no shortcuts, only hard work - all top performers did years of sustained practice
- With deliberate practice the average person can improve greatly (number recall experiment)


### Other interesing ideas

Regular practice vs Deliberate practice
  - pushing the boundaries (outside of comfort zone)
  - fully focused on goal
  - quick feedback
  - identify weakness and fix it

Recepie - 3Fs - Focus, Feedback, Fixit:
- Break the skill down into components, that you can do repeatadly and analyze effectively
- Determine your weaknesses and figure out how to address them
  
Musical student who used deliberate practice, became more successful because they:
  - identify errors better - apply practice better 
    - better able to determine when they made mistakes
    - better able to identify difficult sections, that need more practice
    - better mental representations = better skills

The importance of **Mental Representations**
 - meaning - preexisting mental represantations - it aids memory (random words are harder to remember then a sentence)
 - preexisting patters of information, held in long-term memory - allows to process great amount of information quickly
 - conceptial structure desinged to side step the limitations of the short-term memory imposes on mental processes (7-9 numbers vs 100 numbers recalled)
 - infomration organized in a superior way
 
Innate abilities like IQ, memory, processing speed only affect the performance significantly whan you are a beginner or learning a new skill
  - amongs professional performers, performance correlates with practice/training time not IQ or other innate ability (chess players)
  - the body's and the mind's adaptability outweights any genetic differences that may give some people advantage in the beginning

Knowledge vs Skill
  - knowledge is needed, what you know?
    - facts, concepts, rules - that are stored as individual pieces of information in long term memory, unconnected - limited use
  - skill is useful, what you can do?
    - the pieces are part of an interconnected pattern of mental representations aimed at doing someting - it is easier to use
  - deliberate practice is all about skill, and you pick up the knowledge along the way
  
Simple writing = knowledge telling
Expert writing = knowledge transofrm, the process of writing adds to/changes the knowledge the writer had at the beginning

Homo Sapiens = "Knowing Man", this should be updated to "Practicing Man"
