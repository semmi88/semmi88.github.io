### The main problem/question posed by the book:
- How do people become expert performers?
- Can we learn from expert performers how to improve our skills?

### The main takeaways:
- We are all born with a gift: the adaptability of our mind and body
  - The body's and the mind's adaptability outweights any genetic differences that may give some people advantage in the beginning
- There is no such thing as innate talent, no shortcuts, only hard work
- With deliberate practice the average person can improve greatly (number recall experiment)


### Other interesing ideas

- Homo Sapiens = "Knowing Man", this should be updated to "Practicing Man"
