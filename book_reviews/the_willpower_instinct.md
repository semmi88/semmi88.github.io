![alt text](the_willpower_instinct.jpg "Cover")

### The main problem posed by the book:
* we are too tired to act against our worse impulses
* how to support the exhausted versions of ourselves?

### The main takeaways:

* Inner acceptance = outer control
  * being harder on yourself leads to less motivation and worse self control
  * feeling bad leads to giving in, guilt , shame are your enemies
  * self-forgiveness is your friend
  * observe yourself with curiosity, instead of judgement
  * practice self compassion, image what would you tell a friend in a similar situation?


### Other interesing ideas

Choice architectures 
* make it easier to do the right thing
* reduce the self control demand
* pre-commit, make choices in advnce

10 minute rule
* will power - start for 10 minutes, then you can stop
* won't power - wait for 10 minutes, then do it

Borrowing credit from tomorrow
* we always imagine that tomorrow we will do the right thing
* but in reality, usually we will act the same way in the future as well
* so view every choice you make as a deault for all future behaviors

Reducing variability o your behavior, less choices to make
* want to eat less meat, commit for meat free breakfast & lunch (dinner can be meet)

Moral licensing
* being good gives us permisson to be bad
* this is an incorrect way to view things, don't moralize goo vs bad, instead focus on goals

Meditation benefits
* in meditation you practice the same skill as you need for self control
* you develop the habit of noticing what you are about to do, what are your impulses and so can choose to act or not to act on them
* accepting the presence of your thought, but not believeing it. Thoughts come an go, you can't always control what come to your mindth 
* that's just how your mind works, and it does not necessarily mean anything
* you don't have to automatically accept the content of your thoughts, or act on them. But you could, and that's a choice that's up to you


Dopamine is just a mirage
* promise of reward vs actual reward
* mindful indulging - test the promise of reward 
 * do you fell stress & anxiety
 * does the acting live up to the promise

Ironic rebound effect
* if you try not to think of a white elephant, it becomes impossible
* while trying to avoid the thought, it will keep rebounding, coming back
* diets which focuse on forbidding things some things to eat tend to fail
* instead of prohibitions, flexibility and focusing on positive goals tend to succeed

Surfing the urge = mindfulness training
* notice the presence of the urge, but do not accept is straight away
* urges are temporary, it will pass
* focus on feaalings hot,cold, tension
* focus on you body gut, breath
* notice the frequency and intensity of urges, does it correlates with your emotional state? feeling bad? feeling stressed?
