### Highlevel overview:
Although it is a book written 30 years ago, the ideas it presents are very much relevant in 2020. 
The chapter do not present a story, rather ideas structured around mathematics, physics and philosophy.

### Ideas that struck me the most:

Human flaws, that we are not aware of:
* not understanding exponential scales, even though it is build into our perceptions (vision, hearing)
 * maybe it is built into our brain/thinking as well, resulting in our incapability to understand exponentials rationally?
* humans are terrible at assesing risks
 * large numbers confuse us (lotto)
 * psychological factors like fear, drama, no control - fear of flights
 * loss aversion, omission preferred - if there was a magic drug that saves 95% of sick people, but has side effect of killing 5%, we would never approve it
  * it's better/preferred to do nothing, that to do any harm
  
Science is weird
 * we can predict when a lunar ecplipse will occure precisly, but cannot predict that the sky will be cloudy and there is no point of going to the top of the hill to see it
 * only repeatable phenomena can be measured and predicted (in a hypotetical universe, where the laws are changing, we would not be successful in understanding the universe as we are now)
 * prediction as in foretelling the future in not the goal, nor the forte of science. Predictions are used as guideposts along the way to deeper understanding
