### The main takeaways of the book:
- **A mind model**: a useful way to think of our mind as an interplay of 3 distinct working parts:
  - a chimp - an emotional machine, impulsive, black and white thinking, geared towards survival in the jungle
  - a human - a rational thinker, takes perspective, represents the person you want to be
  - a computer - preprogrammed behavior, habits, automatic thinking and acting 
- **A mind management strategy**: to improve your thinking, using the above model as a bases
  - learn to manage your chimp
  - have a way to stop blaming and criticizing yourself
  - look at things more objectively, with perspective and accept them or improve them
- Beating yourself up is useless and damaging process
  - it is a choice, you don't have to do it
  - attacking and demeaning yourself won't make things better
  - instead choose to look more objectively, accept or improve
  - relax and encourage yourself

### The chimp

The chimp is the part of your brain/personality which is responsible for emotional reactions. It can be described with
 -  black and white thinking, no shades or alternative
 -  it can hijack your thinking and can represent behavior that you don't want
 -  impulse and will hijack you if you allow it
 -  it is not good, nor bad, it is a chimp
 -  it can be your best friend (and save your life) or it can be your worst enemy (an put you terrible situations)
 -  hence the paradox

The chimp is 5 times stronger than the human, so you cannot fight the chimp and win consistently.
Instead you need to learn to manage the chimp. You are responsible for your chimps, just as you would be responsible for your pet dog.

Managing the chimp:
 - exercise the chimp
   - let emotions and thoughts flow, vent it out, talk to someone, write it all down
   - after a while the chimp will be calmer
   - most things said/written like this are irrational and useless, but some might be important
 - box the chimp
   - tell some truths to the chimp, which will help put things in perspective
   - identify unhelpful and destructive believes
   - identify unrealistic expectations

### Unhelpful thinkng and destructive believes
 - You are better/worse than others - vs - All humas are equal and worthy of repect
 - You worth is dependent on your achievements - vs - You are loved and worthy for who you are (your values, personality, attitude) and there's no need to achieve anything
 - (Although achieving things is a good thing)

Why do we fear of failing an exam?
 - we fear because of what others will think of us, and what that implies
 - self worth is tied to an exam result
 - imagine that you could take an exam in secret, the results would not be public, and you could retake the exam as many times as you wanted
 - Would you still fear the exam? Or you would look at it more like a challenge then?

### Unrealistic expectations
Lead to strong negavtive emotions, frustration, anger and disappointment
 
Examples:
 - I should always be on time and never be late - vs - I would like to on time whenever I can, and if I'm late I'll deal with it
