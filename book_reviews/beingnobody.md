 - The thoughts of your mind are not necessarily true, reliable, important or representative of you

- So why is it useful recognize and label thoughts?
  - So you can let go of unwholesome thoughts or subsitute them

### Other interesing ideas

Taking care of our mind, just as we take care of our body - meditation
 - We take baths and clean our body, we exercise and stretch to train our body, we sleep to rest our body.
 - Meditation is a way to take care of and train our mind

Ego = Me delusion
 - When you say "you", where do "you" exits? 
 - Where is the "you" within your body? 
 - Can you point to a part of your brain, where "you" resides?

Your thoughts are not you
 - Why should we trust the mind and the thoughts that arise in the mind?
 - They are not our thoughts, we didn't invite them into our mind, they just arise and vanish naturally. 
 - Impermanence and non-ownership. Just like our body.
 - The thoughts of our mind are not always reliable, trustable, pleasant.
 - The thoughts of our mind are not necessarily true, important or representative of you.

Meditation
 - The mind wants to be entertained.
 - Thoughts and emotions come and go like waves.
 - Don't react and instead just observe how the mind works. 

So why is it useful recognize and label thoughts?
  - So you can let go of unwholesome thoughts or subsitute them
  - Sadness 
     - realize that it will not bring any kind of benefit for anyone, drop or substitute
  - Anger 
     - is useless, whenever you're angry at someone try to remember something nice they did
     - Everybody has some goodness in them
     - Of remember that only unhappy people act in a nasty way, so they are suffering, have compassion

Life is suffering 
  - not in a dramatic, but in the sense that we always want more or want things to stay the same, or we want to change things
  - there is always a next wish, a next problem - unsatisfactoriness
  - nobody has a perfect situation. we can't wait for a perfect situation, because it will never happen
  - so in this sense suffering is sufferring is the only universal truth an if affects all beings

Mindfullness = like breaks on a car
  - dirving without breaks is dangerous
  - living without mindfullness is dangerous
  - if an emotion is unprofitable, hit the breaks
